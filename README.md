### Business Understanding
### Problem Statement

Logistic companies are currently growing rapidly. To keep the company's performance constantly increasing. Customer satisfaction needs to be taken into account

Major factor to ensure customer satisfaction is that each parcel needs to be delivered on time and there are several factors that affect on time delivery. if logistic company not able to deliver customer’s parcel on time, then the customer will lost of interest and give a negative impact to the company such as financial loss and loss of trust. This issues is the main objective for each company to solved it and improve. According to research , accuracy is one of the criteria that customers were satisfied most. (Wan Ahmad, W. N. K., Shamsuddin, A., & Tham, J. H. , 2021).

In order to identify whether a shipment will reach on time or not , I will build a classification model to predict whether a shipment will reach on time or not from several factor such as mode of transport and so on, so that the important result will be used by logistic department, customer services and higher management to improve.

Model performance will be assessed using accuracy. The goal is to achieve an accuracy of at least 70%

The project is appropriately scoped as it involves building a classification model using a dataset with 10,999 entries and a manageable number of features. This scope is neither too aggressive nor too easy.

Predicting whether shipments will arrive on time is valuable for logistics companies to improve their service, customer satisfaction, and operational efficiency. The insights can help in identifying factors that contribute to delays and optimizing the shipping process.

The project will be completed within 3 weeks, including data preprocessing, model development, evaluation, and reporting.
